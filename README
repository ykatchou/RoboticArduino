Actually : Working on a sensors for my Arduinos.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The final goal is to make an autonomous pet for my home.
the first work is to pilot and use sensors, then it will be to integrate the 
whole thing.

Please, don't mind asking me questions about details.
I've voluntary but the references of sensors in the header files in order to
help to build drivers for those sensors.

I've start to use "test" project, but, for now, there not still used.

Each sensor is fully independent and could me use many times.

I voluntary didn't use complex mechanisms in order to extend reliability.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The "brain" of the robot will be made using a RaspberryPI modelB+ which will
pilot 2 Arduinos (one for mobily and pwm, and the other dedicated to sensors).

More doc / picture / features / sensors / ... will come !
